The quality of education we are able to receive for the price of a SUNY school is practically unheard of. Classes can be challenging, but I feel like those challenges have been fair and have helped me to grow and learn, both academically and as a person. Our student body is diverse in all meanings of the term, and the people here have taught me so much about the world at large. There are so many clubs with passionate e-boards who serve our campus by fostering accepting communities. I'm proud to be a Seawolf!Junior2 months agoOverall ExperienceReportReview Stony Brook University, SUNYRating 5 out of 5 \xa0It's been great so far! The campus is always overflowing with people, there are a lot of opportunities to connect with others and lots of fun events. Every year there are multiple festivals and carnivals that the university holds to keep the students engaged. There are also many programs that the university sponsors and supports in order to help the students achieve their personal professional goals. I am personally part of the DPLN program and pledging for BAP, and it has overall been a great experience. I feel like I am really getting the most out of my college education and it has been amazing.Junior5 months agoOverall ExperienceReportRating 5 out of 5 \xa0Stony Brook is an amazing school for those who are interested in research in any field. The anthropology and evolutionary science department is unlike any other in the United States, as well as the vast amount of study abroad opportunities. The only thing I would change about Stony Brook is the parking situation. There is always available spots and buses to take you from far spots, but I wish I could just park near my classes. Other than that, I would recommend Stony Brook to everyone! Going to Stony Brook is the possibility to spend a semester in Madagascar, Korea, Kenya, Tanzania, and so much more!Senior10 months agoOverall ExperienceReportRead More ReviewsAdd to ListAdd To ListNicheAbout UsNiche For SchoolsNiche For CollegesBlogCollege GuidanceResource CenterContact NicheDataCareersPartnershipsPressDo Not Sell My Personal InformationPrivacy PolicyUser AgreementWeb AccessibilityCookie PolicySitemapInstagramFacebookTwitterTiktokDiscordYouTube©2024 Niche.com Inc.Discover the schools, companies, and neighborhoods that are right for you.K-12CollegesGraduate SchoolsPlaces to LiveDo you work for a school or college?
